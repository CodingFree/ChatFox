## When to send a Push Notification?
We should consider the large amount of push notifications that all users will generate. Maybe it's not a good point to send one push notification for each message, it would be floody. Could you imagine your mobile device alerting you each second about new messages? 

I would send a Push Notification, in a first instance, when someone joins the chat and, in future developments, I would send a Push Notification if you are quoted or directly mentioned in the chat, just like a "quack" in the IRC chat.
